This is a machine learning model that can predict if a person is in a risk of heart failure or not based on the medical data of that person. This is a binary classification model built using SVC. This model has been trained on the recorded data from about 900 people and now performs at 85.7% accuracy. 

The dataset for this project was obtained from [heart_data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction?select=heart.csv).

P.S. This is my first machine learning model using numpy, pandas and sklearn. Looking forward to learning more and developing advanced machine learning models in the future.
